OSGi based helper functionality for the COMLI protocol handling. Takes care of detecting
the correct channels for handling the protocol at either the slave or master side. 
<h2>Channels</h2>
<p>
The bundle tracks OSGi services of type {@link org.avineas.io.Channel} and checks for the
property "comli" on the service. <br/>
If this property is set to "slave", the bundle assumes
that the channel is the channel to use for the COMLI slave instances and starts reading
from that channel dispatching received messages to {@link org.avineas.comli.Slave} instances
registered in the OSGi service registry.
<br/> 
If this property is set to "master", the bundle assumes that the channel
is the channel to use for a COMLI master and starts a COMLI
{@link org.avineas.comli.Master} service that communicates via that channel. This master
instance is declared as OSGi service with the same properties as the channel below, which
means that it can be looked-up given those properties.
</p>
<p>
Both type of channels can have a "timeout" property which should contain an integer value
containing the number of milliseconds to use as time-out value while reading from the
channel (as a response from either master/slaves). This value defaults to 3000 ms. The
master channel can also contain a "tries" property, indicating the number of times that
a message is sent to a slave without getting an answer. This value defaults to 3.
</p>
<h2>Masters</h2>
<p>
As already indicated above, a COMLI master service is started for each channel service
that match the master criteria. The master can be looked up as service in the OSGi service
registry.
</p>
<h2>Slaves</h2>
<p>
COMLI slaves are automatically picked up by the bundle if they are declared as OSGi service
under the {@link org.avineas.comli.Slave} interface. The bundle assumes that the service
has a property "identification" containing the integer identification of the slave (which is used
by the master to send data to a specific slave).
