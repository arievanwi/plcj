Implementation of the ABB Comli PLC protocol interfaces both at the slave handling and
the master side.
<h2>Main classes</h2>
<p>
The main classes of this package are {@link org.avineas.comli.impl.MasterImpl} and
{@link org.avineas.comli.impl.SlaveManager}, which as their name already suggest implement
the master and the slave side of the COMLI protocol.
</p>
<p>
{@link org.avineas.comli.impl.MasterImpl} implements the master side taking a channel
to communicate over and a time-out value for responses as parameters. The master sends
a message to a specific slave and waits for the response from the slave. The handling 
depends on the method invoked on the master, as indicates in {@link org.avineas.comli.Master}.
</p>
<p>
{@link org.avineas.comli.impl.SlaveManager} maintains a set of slaves. It reads continuously from
a channel and dispatches the message received to one of the {@link org.avineas.comli.Slave} 
instances it manages. The response from the slave is sent back as a reply to the master. The 
slaves are linked to the slave manager via the {@link org.avineas.comli.impl.SlaveProvider}
interface, in non-OSGi environments normally handled via the 
{@link org.avineas.comli.impl.SimpleSlaveProvider} class.
