Basic interfaces and related classes for the Omron FINS protocol implementation. 
Contains all functionality to be able to communicate to Omron PLCs using the Omron FINS protocol.
<h2>Global use</h2>
<p>
In a FINS environment, all autonomous functional parts that communicate with each other are called
units. As such, software that wants to communicate with other parts in a network must play this
unit role. Units can send commands to each other to which the receiving unit response with an answer.
The contents of this answer depends on the command, for example: a command that writes data at
a specific range of (virtual) addresses just sends a status as response. This while for example
a read command expects that the response contains the data requested.
</p>
<p>
In this package, software that wants to communicate with other units must implement the
{@link org.avineas.fins.Unit} interface. For receiving data, a callback method must be implemented
that should handle the command and return a response. For sending data, the interface contains
an injection method to which a {@link org.avineas.fins.Transmitter} instance is passed. That
instance can be used to send packets to other units.
</p>
<p>
{@link org.avineas.fins.Unit}s must be wired to {@link org.avineas.fins.gw.Gateway} instances, either
by adding them to the gateway for example via dependency injection or -in an OSGI environment- 
by registering the {@link org.avineas.fins.Unit} as an OSGi service. In that case the 
service property "fins.unit.address" must contain the FINS address in the string format 
as expected by the {@link org.avineas.fins.Address} class.
