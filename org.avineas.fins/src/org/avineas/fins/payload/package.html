Basic (not complete) command and response implementations. Contains the classes that represent
the information exchanged during communication between units. The basic class is
{@link org.avineas.fins.payload.Payload}, the base class for all data exchanged, either as
command or as response. As to be expected, both the basic {@link org.avineas.fins.payload.Command} and
{@link org.avineas.fins.payload.Response} classes directly extend the 
{@link org.avineas.fins.payload.Payload} class. Further specializations are:
<ul>
<li>
{@link org.avineas.fins.payload.WriteCommand} which represents a memory area write command, to which
a normal {@link org.avineas.fins.payload.Response} is sent as response, and
</li>
<li>
{@link org.avineas.fins.payload.ReadCommand} which represents a memory area read command, to which a
packet in the form of a {@link org.avineas.fins.payload.ReadResponse} is sent as response. 
</li>
</ul>
Note that although specialized classes exist, no casting to the specialized types must be done
while receiving the command or response. In stead construct the specialized instance using
the constructor accepting the contents of the command/response.
